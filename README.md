# Hangman

This is a hangman game I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
There are a total of ten words from the animal kingdom to guess.
Before the game can be played the start button has to be pressed.
At the top is the total number of letters left to be guessed.
In the middle is the word that is being guessed.
There are dashes instead of the letters and as the player keeps guessing the letters correctly the letters are being revealed.
At the bottom are all of the letters of the alphabet that the player has to click on in order to guess the words.
